#

## Opening Setup
1. **Sign Up or Login**: Follow the on-screen instructions.
    - **Returning Players**: If you've played before, press 'Y' to login.
    - **New Players**: Create a username and a simple password to remember.
    - **Exit**: At the first prompt, you have the option to exit the game by pressing 'E'. (This option is available only at this Opening prompt.)

<br>

## Game Configuration
- **Overview**: Guide you through the game settings. (Additional instructions are provided in-game, but here's a more detailed breakdown.)
    1. **Board Size**: Choose between a 5x5 or 8x8 game board. For example, selecting the 5x5 board results in 5 rows, 5 columns, and 25 '*' markers on the board.
    2. **Number of Ships**: Decide how many ships you'd like hidden on the board. You can choose between 2 to 6 ships.
    3. **Turns**: Select the number of attempts you'll get per game. Options are either 5 or 10 turns.

    ### Game Configuration Tip:
    - If you choose the 5x5 board with 6 ships and pick to play 10 turns, and prepare for alot of hit's!
<br>

## Gameplay

1.  **Gameboard Display**: Once configuration is complete, the game board is displayed with `*` markers, hiding the ships beneath.

2.  **Coordinates**: You are prompted to input row and column numbers. The row starts from the side and goes from left to right starting with , while the column starts from the top and goes down, top to bottom.
     Depending on your board choice, selections range from 1-5 for a 5x5 board and 1-8 for an 8x8 board.  5x5, 25 (`*`) 8x8, 64 (`*`) spots.

3. **Hits & Misses**: After input, the game indicates whether you've hit a ship (`X`) or missed (`M`).
-  Above the gameboard, you'll see the number of remaining hidden ships, your current hits, and the number of turns left.

## Once all turns are used or all ships are found, you'll have two options:
- **Continue**: To play again, enter `Y` at the prompt. You'll return to the login/signup screen. If you're replaying, use your existing username or sign up with a new username.
- **Quit**: To exit the game, type `N`.

Good luck, and enjoy a round of the seas!

# Technologies used

[Python](https://www.python.org/)  -  The primary programming language for game development.

[Editor - VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  -  All coding was conducted with this editor.



## Installation (Cloning the Project)

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Above the list of files, click <> Code.

<details>
<summary>Code Button <> </summary>

<summary>Cloning</summary>

![Alt text](assets/github_images/https-url-clone-cli.webp)

</details>

<br>

3. Rename your repository, if desired.
 
4. Follow the on screen instructions. 

5. Inside your newly cloned page you will find this button "Gitpod"
 in top right corner.

<details><summary>Looks like this</summary>

![Alt text](assets/github_images/gitpod.png)


</details>
<br>

6. Once inside, you will see all the files to your left, a welcome message in the center, and below that, you'll find a terminal window 
    Within the terminal window, run the command in step 7 below to install the required files for the game.

7. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.

# Dependencies
    
   requirements.txt file contains following libraries: 

- gspread
- oauth2client
- bcrypt==3.2.0


### Python Libraries Used

`Import os`
 Used for clearing the terminal screen.

`Import time` 
 Adds pauses or delays in a program.
 
`from random import randint`
 Generates random integers, for random number tasks. 



### Third party Libraries Used



`import gspread` 
 Store/retrieve/modify data in a google Sheet.


`from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials`
 Permission to modify/access Google services.


`import bcrypt`
Securely hashes passwords, ensures password safety in storage.

`"I have to mention"` using google Sheets to store user data isn't best practice.
  It's due to my database setup limitations, it's utilized for this game.
