## User Experience

 **If you're new to Battleship check out this link** ðŸ‘‰ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship

 1. Kick things off with a simple **username prompt** directly on the welcome screen
    i've kept it straightforward so you can dive right in.


 2. Once the **username prompt** has greeted you and you're all set,
    decide on your game's layout. For a quick and compact game, the 5x5 board 
    is your go-to choice. 


 3. With the **board prompt** out of the way, it's time to decide how many ships you'd like 
    to hide on **game board?** more ships on a smaller board means sinkings in abundance.


 4. Next, determine how many turns (or tries) you want to hunt down those elusive ships. 
    from anywhere between 5-10 turns per game. 
    **Here's a hint:**
    If you have chosen the 5x5 board with 6 ships and go for 10 turns, 
    prepare for a sinking bonanza and a large ship graveyard.


 5. Finally, after completing your game, the outcomes of your successful sinkings  
    is displayed over the main game board with number of turns and ships left.  
    Following this, we will pose the big question? Ready to go another round?

### Game settings

1. **Choose between a 5x5 or an 8x8 board** 
2. **Decide on having between 2 to 6 ships**
3. **Determine how many turns to play**













## Design



- **Simplicity:** The design is straightforward,very simple and user-friendly.
- **Clean interface:** Using the 'clear' function, the screen is tidy after each prompt.












## Technologies & Deployment Used


[Python](https://www.python.org/)  -  The primary programming language for game development.

[Editor - VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  -  All coding was conducted within this editor.

[Backend Framework - Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en)  -  Provided backend support for the game.

[Final Hosting Platform - Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)  -  The game was ultimately deployed and hosted on this platform.


## Testing 


[Execution Visualization Tool](https://pythontutor.com/cp/composingprograms.html#mode=edit)
- Excellent for visually understanding and verifying how your code executes.

[Code Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
- keep your Python code neat and PEP 8 friendly.
