## Project Goals

- Battleships is a classic game of strategy and wit. Played on a ruled grid, whether on paper or board, 
- the player must locate a concealed fleet of warships. By taking shots at specific grid coordinates,
- the objective is to identify and sink the entire hidden fleet.






## site-owner-goals


* Create a Battleship game that is intuitive and engaging for the user.
* Ensure that new users can effortlessly sign up.
* Ensure that existing users can log in smoothly.
* Handle and display errors in a clear manner to the user.
* Allow users the option to restart the game.

### User Manual


**If you're new to Battleship check out this link** ðŸ‘‰ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship

* Start with a Sailor Sign in / registration for new Sailors, and simple Login for returning players,
  I've kept it very simple, ensuring you can get back into the battle again.

* Once you've been greeted by the sailor prompt and you're all set,
    it's time to decide on your game's layout. For a quick game, the 5x5 board is a perfect choice.

* After setting up the board prompt, decide how many ships you'd like
    to hide on the game board. Remember: more ships on a smaller board means more chances to sink ships.

* Next, determine the number of turns (or tries) you want for hunting those hidden ships.
    You can choose anywhere between 5-10 turns per game.

    **Here's a hint:**
    
   *   If you've chosen the 5x5 board with 6 ships and go for 10 turns,
   *   get ready for an exciting round filled with sunken ships.
   
   *   Once your game has ended, the outcomes of your successful sinkings are 
   *   displayed on the main game board, and ships left.
    
       - Then, we'll ask: 
       - Ready for another round on the seas?
